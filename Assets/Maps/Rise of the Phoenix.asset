  Name: Rise of the Phoenix
  Description: The First Phoenix has risen again in this region of the world, interrupting
    a long-standing war between four lords.  Defeating the First Phoenix would be
    a great honor, and if you were to do so the other lords would surely give up
    the fight and bow down to you.
