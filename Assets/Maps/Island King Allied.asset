  Name: Island King (Allies)
  Description: The king has died.  He left seven sons and each of them feels entitled
    to the throne.  The rivalry between them is heating up to a battle rage as they
    gather their supporters and rally them to their causes.  The kingdom will surely
    fragment if the issue of the succession is not decided soon.
