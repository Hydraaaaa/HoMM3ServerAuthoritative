  Description: All of your six neighbors have declared a Jihad against you and each
    other, but you have been patient until the signs, omens and priests have agreed
    it is the proper time.  Now you have declared the seventh and final Jihad against
    your enemies.  You will sweep them away like a vast desert sandstorm.
