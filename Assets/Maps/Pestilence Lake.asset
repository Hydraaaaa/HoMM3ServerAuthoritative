  Description: Pestilence Lake is located in a valley deep in a foreboding mountain
    range.  You have always felt your lack of neighbors was an advantage to your
    location.  Recently several Lords have moved into the area.  Now they are trying
    to push you out.  You plan to shove them out instead!
